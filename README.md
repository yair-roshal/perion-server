 Creating a full-fledged ReactJS application involves multiple files and a project structure. The application would pull data from a weather API of your choice and display it in a neat UI. Requirements:
1. In the App startup user would enter his email address. Consider that as his “authentication/authorization” process. No need for password authentication. If you want to do so, you are welcome, but it’s not mandatory.
2. Default location would be your location.
3. Searching for different locations would result in weather that is relevant to this
location.
4. Refresh would return to the last location you searched for.
5. Exiting the app and returning to it would return to the last location. This data
should be consistent across devices.
6. “Share” button would share the page to a different user. The link would lead the
recipient to the current location
Required Stack:
- Frontend: ReactJS or NextJS
- Backend: Nodejs.
- Databases: your choice.
- Styling: your choice.
